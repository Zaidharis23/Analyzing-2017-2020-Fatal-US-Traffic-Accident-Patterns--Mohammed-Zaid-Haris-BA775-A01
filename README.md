# Analyzing-2017-2020-Fatal-US-Traffic-Accident-Patterns--Mohammed-Zaid-Haris-BA775-A01

**Overview**

It goes without saying that road safety has been and always will be a major concern of the U.S. government and citizens alike. Road safety impacts the lives of almost every individual in the U.S. every single day in some shape or form. Whether by driving or using a ride app to get from point A to point B or simply crossing the street, it is a constant fixture of daily life.

Furthermore, given that 40,990 lost their lives last year in traffic accidents and the broad “Accident” category (Including all varieties of unintentional injuries, of which ~18% were car accidents) is the third leading cause of death in the U.S., there is significant room for improvement in this area. 

With all of this in mind, our goal was to use *U.S. Fatal Traffic Accidents 2017-2020 Data* (NHTSA, BigQuery) to better understand the factors associated with fatal traffic accidents in the United States. From there, we aimed to provide recommendations to the U.S. Government on better preventing and responding to traffic accidents.

To reach these insights, we wanted to understand:
* What are the common times of accidents?
* What are the impacts of environmental factors?
* Are there any patterns of collision types and causes?
* How do victim demographics factor in?
* How do accident rates compare across states?
